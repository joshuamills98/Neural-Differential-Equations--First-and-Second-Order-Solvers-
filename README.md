# Neural-Differential-Equations--First-and-Second-Order-Solvers-
In this project I experiment with Physics Informed Neural Networks to solve first and second order ODEs. Please feel free to use the code.
I was heavily inspired by https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKHl68Fdpq4&ab_channel=ParallelComputingandScientificMachineLearning which presents a great demonstration of the theory behind
PINNs!
